  "confidenceLevelGFWGladAlerts": "Probable loss is defined as a single observation to date flagged as loss. If there are repeat loss observations within 4 observations or 180 days it becomes confirmed loss, otherwise, it reverts back to no loss.",
  "confidenceLevelGFWIntegratedAlerts": "Confidence levels help forest monitors prioritize alerts for follow up since satellite-derived data is subject to errors including false alerts. If two or more alert systems detect a change in the same location, we are more confident (&quot;highest confidence&quot;) that these alerts indicate real disturbance. For individual systems, there is a delay before a first detection can be verified by additional satellite passes and thus reach &quot;high confidence.&quot; The integrated layer displays where multiple systems overlap, in some cases providing increased confidence faster than waiting for individual systems to reach high confidence through additional satellite images, which can take weeks or months. False positives are effectively eliminated in the highest confidence class as it's uncommon for two systems to commit the same error since they use different data streams and algorithms.",
  "confidenceLevelNasaVIIRSFireAlerts": "This value is based on a collection of intermediate algorithm quantities used in the detection process. It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence values are set to low, nominal and high. &quot;Low&quot; confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (&lt;15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. &quot;Nominal&quot; confidence pixels are those free of potential sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (&gt;15K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. &quot;High&quot; confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels.",
  "confidenceLevelTerrasImazonGoldMining": "1: High confidence level. It has all the characteristics of gold mining. 0: Low confidence level. It is possible to see the change in land cover, but it is not possible to be sure that it is gold mining.",
