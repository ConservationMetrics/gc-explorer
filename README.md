# GuardianConnector Explorer

This tool, designed for GuardianConnector and built using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), offers an API compatible with a PostgreSQL databases, and renders tabular data from one or more tables on different views including a map and a media gallery.

## Configure

To get started, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your database and table information, authentication, and a Mapbox access token.

**Database:** Provide your database information in the relevant variables.

**Authentication strategy:** GuardianConnector Explorer supports three different authentication strategies: auth0, password (from an environmental var) with JWT key, or none. Set your authentication strategy in `NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_STRATEGY`.

* If you are using an auth0 strategy, then you need to provide a domain, client ID, client secret, audience, and base URL.

**Nuxt App API key:** Generate an API key to add to request headers made by the Nuxt front end. You can generate one by running `openssl rand -base64 42`.

**Views configuration:** GuardianConnector Explorer can render multiple tables and you can determine which views to show for each table. To configure your tables and views, access the `/config` route once the application has started. For more information on this, please see [config.md](docs/config.md). You do not need to set this in order for GuardianConnector Explorer to start, however the index page will show an empty list and none of the view routes will load anything.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ pnpm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ pnpm dev

# build for production and launch server
$ pnpm build
$ pnpm start

# generate static project
$ pnpm generate
```

Add `--hostname 0.0.0.0` if you want the app to be accessible across your local network.

## Deployment

For deployment (e.g. on Azure), the following additional env vars are needed:

```
HOST: 0.0.0.0
NODE_ENV: production
```

Local deployment of Docker:

```sh
docker run --env-file=.env -it -p 8080:8080 guardianconnector-explorer:latest
```

## How it works

### Column headers ###

Currently, GuardianConnector expects these column headers, which follow the structure of a GeoJSON feature. You can use these [GeoJSON to SQL conversion scripts](https://github.com/rudokemper/geojson-csv-sql-conversion-tools) to transform your GeoJSON file into the expected format if needed.

| SQL Column | GeoJSON Field |
|------------|---------------|
| id         | id            |
| g\_\_type    | geometry.type |
| g\_\_coordinates | geometry.coordinates |
| p\_\_...     | properties... |
| p\_\_\_...     | properties.$... |

If found, GuardianConnector Explorer will use a column mapping SQL table (with "__column" suffix), like the one created by the `warehouse` component of [Frizzle](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/frizzle), to handle filtering and key/value rewrites.

 Any columns specified in the `.env` file will be filtered out (*see "Unwanted columns and substrings" above*).

At this time, media attachments in the popups are handled in a somewhat brittle way by embedding any strings that end in the expected photo, audio, or video file ending (such as `.jpg`, `.mp3`, or `.mp4`). We can improve on this later when we know more about how media attachments will be stored in the SQL database, and what kind of metadata we have access to.

### GeoJSON export formats for map view ###

The GuardianConnector Explorer map will render the feature on a map in accordance to what kind of `type` it is (Point, LineString, Polygon). The properties are shown in a popup opened by clicking on the feature.

The GuardianConnector Explorer map can work with any GeoJSON data stored in the expected tabular format, but the main purpose is to visualize field data collected using data collection applications such as Mapeo, OpenDataKit (ODK), and KoboToolbox. 

* Mapeo data from Mapeo Desktop is already exported as GeoJSON file. The GuardianConnector Explorer map can work with both Observations and Territory data.
* ODK / KoboToolbox API survey data with a geospatial column may be transformed into such a format (as CMI does using [Frizzle](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/frizzle) components).
* In the future, we can do a similar transformation for Mapeo Cloud API data, if needed.
